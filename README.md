# Instagram-User-Data-Analytics
This is the second project of the Trainity Data Analytics Program where the Instagram User data has been provided with tables like users, posts, comments, likes, posts etc. from which we are required to provide useful insights which can be useful for the business stakeholders.
This model project which uses real-world dataset has provided me a grip on how to use various SQL functions and queries to efficiently derive meaningful insights from raw data.
The project aims to find out how much Instagram has reached users and take data-driven decisions on how to further engage more users on the platform. I have used MySQL to perform the required tasks.
